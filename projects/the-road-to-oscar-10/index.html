<p>Oscar 0.7 was <a href="http://django-oscar.readthedocs.org/en/latest/releases/v0.7.html">released this
week</a>,
a comparatively minor house-keeping release that allowed us to reduce
our pull-request and issue backlogs. We have a plan for Oscar through
2014 and this article outlines the roadmap.</p>

<h3 id="v1-0">v1.0</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re aiming to be v1.0 before the end of the year<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Oscar has been
beta for nearly two years and its APIs are stabilising. We&rsquo;re ready to
commit to the backward compatibility responsibilities associated with
coming out of beta.</p>

<p>Plus, this will help <a href="http://www.tangentsnowball.com/">Tangent Snowball</a>
(who sponsor Oscar&rsquo;s development) promote Oscar to blue-chip or
&ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; clients, who feel nervous enough using open-source
e-commerce software, let alone <em>beta</em> open-source software.</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t a lot to do before this milestone. Oscar&rsquo;s philosophy is to
keep the core package lean and flexible, hence we don&rsquo;t have a large
shopping list of features we want to add. Rather, there are a few areas
that need careful review to ensure they are flexible enough. Also, there
are a few topics that we want to research thoroughly in case they have
design implications.</p>

<p>These are detailed here:</p>

<h4 id="product-dashboard">Product dashboard</h4>

<p>The current version uses a one-size-fits-all approach which is now
stretched to breaking point trying to handle a wide range of scenarios.
In particular, it&rsquo;s not easy to administer group and variant products
using the current implementation<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A new, carefully considered version will be built that provides separate
views and forms for the different work-flows. The new implementation
will be simpler than the current, provide a superior user experience and
be easier to customise and extend.</p>

<p>This piece of work is scheduled to be looked at by Tangent&rsquo;s UX team
shortly and should land in master over the summer.</p>

<h4 id="multi-tenancy">Multi-tenancy</h4>

<p>We&rsquo;re aiming to provide better support for multi-tenanted sites where a
single dashboard is used to manage a product catalogue that can be used
across several sites. Several people on the mailing list have requested
this, and Tangent have a forthcoming project that will require a form of
this.</p>

<p>This poses some tricky design questions around how products, categories
and offers are linked to sites. It&rsquo;s tempting to slap a new many-to-many
relationship onto every core model that links them to sites, but this
may not be the right approach as it will add extra joins to SQL queries.
Some careful research is required: we don&rsquo;t want to impair performance
for the many to satisfy the requirements of the few.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be talking to several people at DjangoCon EU 2014 about how
Tangent can partner with other Oscar implementors to first design the
appropriate handling, and later drive forward an implementation.</p>

<h4 id="faceted-browsing-everywhere">Faceted browsing everywhere</h4>

<p>Oscar uses <a href="http://haystacksearch.org/">Haystack</a> for search (with a
preference for <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a>) and has some
<a href="https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar/blob/master/oscar/apps/search/facets.py">custom
helpers</a>
to make working with facets easier. Facets are great for customers
whenever they&rsquo;re browsing a list of products and it&rsquo;s desirable to allow
faceting on all product browsing views. This would require using the
search back-end to drive all browsing views.</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topicsearchin/django-oscar/haystack%7Csort:date%7Cspell:true/django-oscar/7cykIQSS7lw">initial
work</a>
has been done on this already. We intend to review and merge this into
master soon.</p>

<h4 id="research-topics">Research topics</h4>

<p>Some things to look into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oscar ships with a set of translation message files but doesn&rsquo;t
currently provide built-in support for translating model content
into multiple languages. There are <a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/model-translation/">various Django
libraries</a>
that address this issue already. We need to research the best
approach (or approaches) and document how to use them with Oscar.</li>
<li>Since Oscar is just a set of apps, it works with all existing
<a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/model-translation://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/cms/">Django CMS
packages</a>.
However, more research is required to find the right way to
integrate content management. With its &ldquo;promotions&rdquo; app, Oscar
already provides some limited forms of merchandising but it might be
better to drop this app and provide better hooks for CMS packages to
manage all content. We&rsquo;ll see.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thanks">Thanks</h3>

<p>As ever, we&rsquo;re hugely grateful to the work of the community: submitting
pull requests, adding translations, reporting bugs.</p>
