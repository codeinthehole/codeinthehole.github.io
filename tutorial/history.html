			History
		</h2>
		<p>
		The CGLE marries several  key concepts which were developed in the years before
		the CGLE became well-known, particularly in the context of pattern formation.
		Thus, we first review the origins of these concepts before giving the first
		uses of the RGLE and CGLE.
		</p>		
		<p><a class="ref" href="references.html#landau44">Landau (1944)</a> was the first
		to make use of slow relaxation times in an investigation into turbulence.  (This
		was also one of the earliest uses of a weakly nonlinear expansion.) In relation
		to pattern formation, this approach was introduced by <a class="ref" href="references.html#stuart60">Stuart (1969)</a>.
		<a class="ref" href="references.html#landau37">Landau (1937)</a> was also the first to
		propose slow spatial dependence in the context of x-ray scattering by crystals.
		However, the concept became well-known through the success of his collaboration with
		Ginzburg (<a class="ref" href="references.html#ginzburg50">Ginzburg and Landau, 1950</a>) which
		spawned the so-called Ginzburg-Landau theory for superconductivity.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Real Ginzburg-Landau equations were first derived as long-wave amplitude equations by
		<a class="ref" href="references.html#newell69">Newell and Whitehead (1969)</a> and
		<a class="ref" href="references.html#segel69">Segel (1969)</a> in the context of 
		convection in binary mixtures near the onset of instability.
		Complex Ginzburg-Landau
		equations were first derived by <a class="ref" href="references.html#stewartson71">Stewartson and Stuart (1971)</a>
		who studied Poiseuille flow, and by <a class="ref" href="references.html#ermentrout81">Ermentrout (1981)</a> through
		the investigation of reaction-diffusion systems.
