      <description>Last Wednesday was my last day at Yoyo Wallet. Thursday marked my first day at Octopus Energy.
I&amp;rsquo;m deeply excited about Octopus. Through innovative use of technology, especially automation and cloud computing, Octopus Energy is going to radically change how people consume and pay for energy in the UK. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be both cheaper and massively better at customer service than the much-maligned incumbents.
Right now, we&amp;rsquo;re looking to build a superb tech team.</description>
