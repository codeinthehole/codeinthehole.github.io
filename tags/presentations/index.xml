      <description>The presentation I gave at Confoo 2011 is now available online, there is feedback on joind.in.
The slides are written in Eric Meyer&amp;rsquo;s S5, which is a XHTML, CSS and Javascript based slide show format. I enjoyed using this as it was easy to port my styles across from the website CSS file, it also means the presentation is viewable as a normal webpage (no flash required). However, the downside is that it is not easy to submit the slides to Slideshare which is the common thing to do.</description>
