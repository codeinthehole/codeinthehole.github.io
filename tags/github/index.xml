      <description>URLs are great aren&amp;rsquo;t they?
You include them in your Slack messages and your co-workers can see exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about in a single click. I wish people would use them more (and design apps that support them properly).
Anyway, a super-useful Vim mapping I use is:
vnoremap &amp;lt;leader&amp;gt;gb :GBrowse! master:%&amp;lt;cr&amp;gt;which, after visually selecting a block of code, grabs its Github URL from the HEAD of master and copies it to the clipboard.</description>

      <description>I spend most of my day reviewing pull requests in Github. These are my working notes on what makes a good PR.
Purpose? It should be clear to the reviewer what change is being made and, crucially, why. So ensure your title and description convey the purpose of the PR. Consider including:
  Screenshots &amp;mdash; such as snaps or gifs of a new UI, or graphs of the devastating performance improvement your PR delivers.</description>
