      <description>This post details a Bash script that runs a TDD loop where an LLM is iteratively used to write Python application code to make a fixed set of tests pass.&#xA;Similar things have been done before1; this script merely demonstrates that such things can be done simply by stitching together open-source LLM tools.&#xA;Tooling The script uses two commands from Simon Willison:&#xA;llm â€” a command line interface for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs).</description>

      <description>Two tips:&#xA;Fail fast You probably already know that you can force Bash scripts to exit immediately if there&amp;rsquo;s an error (that is, if any command exits with a non-zero exit code) using:&#xA;#!/usr/bin/env bash set -e but it&amp;rsquo;s even better to use:&#xA;set -eu -o pipefail so that the script:&#xA;exits on an error (-e, equivalent to -o errexit); exits on an undefined variable (-u, equivalent to -o nounset); exits on an error in piped-together commands (-o pipefail)1.</description>

      <title>Reorganising a Consul key-value store</title>

      <description>If your Consul key-value store is structured as:&#xA;/ A/ X = 1 Z = 2 Y = 3 C D but you now realise you should have namespaced everything within WEBSERVER/ (or something like that):&#xA;/ WEBSERVER/ A/ X = 1 Z = 2 Y = 3 C D then this Bash script will help you migrate:&#xA;#!/bin/bash set -e # Exit on error # Emit &amp;#34;key value&amp;#34; lines for all keys in Consul&amp;#39;s KV store keys_and_values() { # Recursively fetch all values from Consul but exclude: # (a) those that end in / (as these are folders) # (b) those that start with WEBSERVER/ (as that&amp;#39;s where we are migrating # to).</description>

      <description>UNIX is a majestic onion of discovery. Every day a new layer of understanding can be peeled away to give some new pungent goodness. Today&amp;rsquo;s was the &amp;lsquo;follow&amp;rsquo; option of the tail command.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s commonplace to use tail for viewing the recent entries to a log file:&#xA;tail /var/log/apache2/error.log Much more useful is set the &amp;lsquo;follow&amp;rsquo; option so that, rather than echoing to STDOUT and returning control to the prompt - tail continues to watch the file in question and echos additional lines to the terminal.</description>
