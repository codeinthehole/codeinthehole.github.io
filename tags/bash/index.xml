      <title>Reorganising a Consul key-value store</title>

      <description>If your Consul key-value store is structured as:
/ A/ X = 1 Z = 2 Y = 3 C D  but you now realise you should have namespaced everything within WEBSERVER/ (or something like that):
/ WEBSERVER/ A/ X = 1 Z = 2 Y = 3 C D  then this Bash script will help you migrate:
#!/bin/bash set -e # Exit on error # Emit &amp;quot;key value&amp;quot; lines for all keys in Consul&amp;#39;s KV store keys_and_values() { # Recursively fetch all values from Consul but exclude: # (a) those that end in / (as these are folders) # (b) those that start with WEBSERVER/ (as that&amp;#39;s where we are migrating # to).</description>

      <description>UNIX is a majestic onion of discovery. Every day a new layer of understanding can be peeled away to give some new pungent goodness. Today&amp;rsquo;s was the &amp;lsquo;follow&amp;rsquo; option of the tail command.
It&amp;rsquo;s commonplace to use tail for viewing the recent entries to a log file:
tail /var/log/apache2/error.log  Much more useful is set the &amp;lsquo;follow&amp;rsquo; option so that, rather than echoing to STDOUT and returning control to the prompt - tail continues to watch the file in question and echos additional lines to the terminal.</description>
