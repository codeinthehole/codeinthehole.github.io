      <description>Someone has asked a question (in Slack or Github) and you&amp;rsquo;re about to write an explanation. But before you start typing, ask yourself this:
Is this the best place to answer this question?
Because the place where the question is asked is generally not the best place to write a detailed answer.
&amp;ldquo;Why did you do it that way?&amp;rdquo; Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve requested a review on a Github pull request and one of the reviewers has questioned why something is done the way it is.</description>

      <description>On code smells:
If your codebase is tightly coupled to data in your database (ie the codebase has a data value hard-coded), it is a sign you should extract that data from your database into a code-layer model.
Never use numbered variable names (eg account1 = ...) &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s always a better way.
On good things I always tell team members about:
The writing and conference talks by James Mickens are great - start with &amp;ldquo;Computers are a sadness, I am the cure&amp;rdquo; from Monitorama 2014.</description>
