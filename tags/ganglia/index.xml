      <description>Following some server monitoring advice from the excellent &amp;lsquo;Building Scalable Web Sites&amp;rsquo; by Cal Henderson, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been experimenting with Ganglia on a cluster of servers at Tangent Labs. It has proved to be deeply impressive and has given us a great tool for keeping an eye on how our servers are performing, as well as providing an invaluable diagnostic tool should things go wrong.&#xA;In essence, Ganglia is a distributed monitoring application that allows statistics on a cluster of servers to be aggregated in a single place.</description>
