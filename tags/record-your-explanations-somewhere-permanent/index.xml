      <description>Someone has asked a question (in Slack or Github) and you&amp;rsquo;re about to write an explanation. But before you start typing, ask yourself this:
 Is this the best place to answer this question?
 Because the place where the question is asked is generally not the best place to write a detailed answer.
&amp;ldquo;Why did you do it that way?&amp;rdquo; Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve requested a review on a Github pull request and one of the reviewers has questiond why something is done the way it is.</description>
