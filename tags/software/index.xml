      <description>I care about writing maintainable software1: code that is a pleasure to work with in the long-term; where new requirements can be accommodated smoothly and swiftly &amp;ndash; above all, software that is easy to change.
Memorise that phrase.
I feel we lose sight of this overarching guiding principle and harm our codebases by dogmatically pursuing well-intentioned but proximate goals.
The main thing the future maintainer of your code (i.e. you) cares about is whether the code is easy to change2.</description>
