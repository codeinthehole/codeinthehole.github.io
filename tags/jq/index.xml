      <description>I spend at least 50% of each day reviewing, amended (and occasionally merging) pull requests, adding both commits and comments. As such I often want to quickly jump from a terminal window to the pull request detail page to check previous comments or add new.
Even with the excellent hub git wrapper, there&#39;s no easy way to do this. I can jump to the pull request list page with:
$ git pulls where pulls is aliased in ~/.</description>

      <description>Like many people, I use Google Sheets to quickly create and share tabular data. As well as creating spreadsheets by pasting results generated in psql, I often create reports from JSON files using JQ. This post is a note-to-self on how to do this.

      <description>If your Consul key-value store is structured as:
/ A/ X = 1 Z = 2 Y = 3 C D but you now realise you should have namespaced everything within WEBSERVER/ (or something like that):
/ WEBSERVER/ A/ X = 1 Z = 2 Y = 3 C D then this Bash script will help you migrate:
#!/bin/bash  set -e # Exit on error # Emit &amp;#34;key value&amp;#34; lines for all keys in Consul&amp;#39;s KV store keys_and_values() { # Recursively fetch all values from Consul but exclude: # (a) those that end in / (as these are folders) # (b) those that start with WEBSERVER/ (as that&amp;#39;s where we are migrating # to).</description>
