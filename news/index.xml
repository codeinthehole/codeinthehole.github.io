      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve migrated this site to Hugo so I can host it on Github pages1.
Hugo is a fast and well thought-out static site generator, written in Golang. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to learn and has some neat features2 - the trickiest part is understanding the difference between various ways pages are organised: &amp;ldquo;sections&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;types&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;taxonomies&amp;rdquo; etc.
The Vim plugin vim-markdown provides good support for authoring Hugo posts since it supports syntax-highlighting for:</description>

      <description>Last Wednesday was my last day at Yoyo Wallet. Thursday marked my first day at Octopus Energy.
I&amp;rsquo;m deeply excited about Octopus. Through innovative use of technology, especially automation and cloud computing, Octopus Energy is going to radically change how people consume and pay for energy in the UK. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be both cheaper and massively better at customer service than the much-maligned incumbents.
Right now, we&amp;rsquo;re looking to build a superb tech team.</description>

      <description>For the record, I no longer maintain commandlinefu.com. I&amp;rsquo;ve handed over the baton to notable Bay Area celebrity, Jon Hendren (@fart). This is a good thing for the site and its users as I have been unable to do much maintenance in recent times. I look forward to seeing how the site evolves.</description>

      <description>I rewrote this blog recently with the following aims:
 to make it as easy as possible to create a new article, using reStructuredText (RST); to clean up and simplify the design, focussing on the readability of articles that include code snippets.  I knew that there were various static blogs out there, with many supporting RST, but I still fancied the challenge of crafting something specific to my needs.</description>
